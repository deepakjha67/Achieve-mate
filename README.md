💡 Why I Built This
As an Engineering student, I noticed a recurring problem: it is incredibly easy to lose track of progress when self-studying complex subjects like Data structures or engineering syllabus.

Traditional "To-Do" apps felt sterile and unmotivating. I built Achieve-mate to solve three specific pain points:

The Tracking Gap: It’s hard to visualize how much of a 50-video YouTube course you’ve actually finished.

The Focus Struggle: Standard timers don't provide a dedicated "space" for deep work.

The Consistency Drop: Without immediate rewards, long-term habits are hard to maintain.


✨ Key Features

🎮 Gamified Progression: Earn XP for completing daily goals and lectures. Level up and unlock 17 unique badges.

⏱️ Deep Work Focus Mode: A full-screen Pomodoro timer featuring Pause/Resume logic and task-specific tracking.

📚 Smart Learning Playlists: Create courses from any source. Use the Auto-generate tool to instantly build structured lecture lists.

📊 Consistency Analytics: View progress through a 7-day habit graph and a detailed Activity Log synced to a personal calendar.

📱 PWA Ready: Installable on Android and iOS for a seamless, native app-like experience.

☁️ Cloud Sync: Secure login and real-time data persistence powered by Firebase.


🛠️ Technical Stack

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Modern Flex/Grid), Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).

Backend: Firebase Firestore for real-time cloud storage.

Authentication: Firebase Auth with secure email verification flows.


🧭 The New User Experience (Onboarding)

I designed Achieve-mate to be intuitive from the very first click:

Interactive Welcome Guide: New users are greeted with a dedicated overlay explaining the core ecosystem.

Morning Prompt: To build discipline, the app checks every morning if you've set your daily goals, ensuring you never start the day without a plan.

Safe Data Loading: A merge strategy ensures that even when I update the app features, your existing progress is never lost.
